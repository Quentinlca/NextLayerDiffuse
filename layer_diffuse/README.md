# Layer Diffuse

A layer by layer diffusion model implementation done for a DTU internship on layered image generation/decomposition

## Overview

This repository contains code and experiments related to diffusion-based generative models, focusing on applications to layered data structures.

## Features

- Implementation of diffusion models for layered data
- Training and evaluation scripts
- Utilities for data preprocessing and visualization

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/layer_diffuse.git
cd layer_diffuse
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To train and use layer by layer models, use the `training.ipynb` notebook.
